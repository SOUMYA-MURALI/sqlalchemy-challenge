Climate Analysis of Hawaii

I’m planning a holiday vacation to Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I need to do some climate analysis on the area.
•	Used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis & data exploration and to create climate app of Hawaii climate database.
•	Used SQLAlchemy create_engine to connect to your sqlite database.
•	Used SQLAlchemy automap_base () to reflect your tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called Station and Measurement.
•	I can choose a start date and end date for my trip, but it should be within 3-15 days total


	Climate Analysis and Data Exploration
Done precipitation analysis and station analysis using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Used the provided starter notebook and hawaii.sqlite files to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.


	Create Climate App
Designed a Flask API based on the queries that you have developed. Used FLASK to create routes.


	Optional
Temperature Analysis: - Calculated the min temp, avg temp and max temperature for the range of dates. Calculated trip average temperature.
Daily Rainfall Average: -Calculated total amount of rainfall per weather station for the trip dates using previous years matching dates.
